# Palmer Penguins Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes the Palmer Penguins dataset to study penguin species, islands, and physical characteristics. It uses statistical methods and hypothesis testing to explore differences among groups and develop insights into penguin attributes.

## Objectives
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Visualize species, islands, and physical features.
  - Assess correlations and distributions.
  - Statistical Analysis:
- Fit a Log-Normal distribution to body mass using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
    - Perform t-tests to compare physical attributes between sexes.
- Conduct ANOVA to evaluate differences across islands.
  
## Key Findings
Chinstrap penguins have the longest bills; Gentoo penguins are the heaviest.
Male penguins have significantly larger body mass and dimensions than females (p < 0.05).
Physical characteristics vary significantly among islands (p < 0.05).

# Requirements
  - R libraries: palmerpenguins, ggplot2, dplyr, MASS
  - How to Use
  - Clone the repository:
      - bash
      - Copy code
